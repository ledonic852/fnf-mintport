Value 1: Value,Mode
Value 2: Duration,Ease
If Mode is "absolute", then the scroll speed will be
equal to the Value, else the Value will be multiplied
by the song's original scroll speed.
Duration works in Steps.
Ease can be skipped as the default one is "linear".
Leave Value 2 blank if you want the zoom to be instant.
